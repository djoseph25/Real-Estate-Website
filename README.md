- Designed mobile responsive experience using CSS media queries to create breakpoints at various window view widths,
  ensuring consistent delivery of a high-quality dynamic UI and intuitive UX built with custom CSS for devices

  storage to address authentication and security concerns and tested API routes through Insomnia and Postman.
- Architected RESTful API utilizing Express.JS as the server to save notes in MongoDB with lightweight middleware to
   handle logging, cors & email notifications to the user, which deploys in a Travis CICD pipeline through Heroku.
- Developed a testing suite of 25 consecutive passing tests with Mocha, Chai, and Jest to develop unit, integration,
   and snapshot testing for web components and Express.JS server.
